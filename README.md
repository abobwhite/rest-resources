## Usage

For instructions on how to use rest-resources, see the [documentation](https://abobwhite.github.io/rest-resources/)

## Contributing

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running, you will need to install the following:

* [Node v14](https://nodejs.org)

### Installing

* Install dependencies: `npm i`
* Bootstrap Lerna: `npm run lerna boostrap`
* Install docs dependencies (if necessary): `npm run docs:install`

## Running the tests

Run tests from the repository root: `npm test`

## Editing the Docs

Any good library requires complete and up-to-date documentation. If functionality is added, altered, or removed, the documentation must be changed with it corresponding to the correct version.

The documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io). Follow the documentation there when editing files in the `website` and `docs` folders

### Running the docs locally

Simply run `npm run docs:start` to run and open the docs at `http://localhost:3000/rest-resources`. As you edit, the docs will auto-reload in the browser with the resulting build.

## Publishing

Publishing requires permission for this package through npmjs.org.

To publish, run `npm publish`. Publishing uses Lerna.

### Publishing Docs
To publish the docs to Github pages, run `GIT_USER=<github_username> USE_SSH=true npm run docs:publish` where you replace `<github_username>`. This will publish to https://abobwhite.github.io/rest-resources/ 

## Built With
